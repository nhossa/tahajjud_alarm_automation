I need to code somethihng to run this when i am offline

startying on getting location
a problem could be what if i am offline when travelling




after that i need to use location to get the right prayer time
\
afgter that i need to subtract 30 or whatever number and send alarm system to phone

after this sends i need to check if i leave my location with an arbitrary time like an hour to see if I actually woke up for fajr

Whether i leave or not I have to determine success so lets say fajr success is one metric

after this i log the results of that day into a text file which i then send over to the cloud

after one week lambda sends me a summary of the week via email
